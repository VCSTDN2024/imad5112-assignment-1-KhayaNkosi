## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to suggest meals for users who can't decide on what to eat during the day.The user would put in the time of day then press the suggestion button and it would suggest meal for that specific time . 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: The key feature would be the user being able to input a time.
- Feature 2: Another feature that would be in this application would be the meals being displayed after the user has clicked on the suggestion button.

- Feature 4: The other features would be when the user puts in the wrong input it will show that the user has put in the incorrect input and suggest them to fix.

This features are used to make the application function better and smoothly and make it a bit more user freindly so its easier for users to make the application function.

4. Design Considerations

The design of the **Meal prep application** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.

3. **Simplicity**: The Application was used to be simple for users and help users to understand it better.The buttons were spaced out evenly.
   
4. **Performance**: The apps performance is quick and it has a low battery usage for the phone.


5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project thats called Meal Prep was managed using **GitHub** for version control and automation, where all code changes for my meal prep application were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated tests such as **build.yml** to ensure the appâ€™s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: The first challenge I got was linking my suggestion button to my if statement.
   - **Solution**: I used the private fun checksuggestion to reference the btnSuggestMealType.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: I had problems running my app and it showed avd terminated. 
   - **Solution**: I deleted my android studios and I deleted my avd file and downloaded it again.
   - 
3.**Challenge 3**: isEmpty function wasn't working properly 
   - **Solution**: I used a IsNotEmpty function and it worked properly.

From these challenges, I learn't how to reference properly and how to use error handling.

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------
## Future Enhancements

While this app still function, the future enchancments that I would like to add this features in the future 

1. **Feature 1**: I would add multiple screen's to suggest diffrent meals
2. **Feature 2**: I would include images in program.When the user inputs a time


These enhancements would improve the app and makes it more usable and easier for everyone to understand it well
